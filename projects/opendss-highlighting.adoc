In my graduation project I made extensive use of the distribution system simulation capabilities of link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/[OpenDSS].
At the time I was using link:https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit[Gedit] as my main text editor, and so I created an link:https://github.com/nicorikken/opendss-highlight[OpenDSS syntax highlighter for Gedit].

.TODO
- [ ] Add more logic to only highlight valid combinations of parameters. +
      Compared to the <<atom-glm-language-support#,GridLAB-D syntax>> the OpenDSS syntax is not extensible, which makes it an even better candidate for a more conditional highlighting.
- [ ] Bring highlighting support to my now favorite editor link:https://atom.io/[Atom] for an experience that is also cross-platform.
