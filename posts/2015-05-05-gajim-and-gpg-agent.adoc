Since I’ve started using link:http://gajim.org/[Gajim] I’ve been trying to get it working using the GPG Agent rather than the built-in GPG option.
The practical benefit is that I’m no longer required to insert my passphrase each time I open up my laptop, as the passphrase is part of my keychain, just like I have enabled from my link:https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution[Evolution] email client.
It took me quite a while to get it working, and looking by the number of reported tickets others had difficulties as well.
I finally got it working by ultimately trusting the receivers key.
In order to keep others from having similar issues, I’ve filed a link:https://trac.gajim.org/ticket/8041[ticket] on the trust level and a link:https://trac.gajim.org/ticket/8040[ticket] on the error.
