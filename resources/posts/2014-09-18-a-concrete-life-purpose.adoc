At TEDxMalibu Adam Leipzig gave a link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M[talk] on defining your life purpose by way of referring to more solid aspects. If you have a sense of your life purpose but arenâ€™t able to make it concrete, just consider clarifying the five aspects that make up your life purpose:

. Who are you?
. What do you do?
. Who do you do it for?
. What do those people want or need?
. How will they change as a result?
