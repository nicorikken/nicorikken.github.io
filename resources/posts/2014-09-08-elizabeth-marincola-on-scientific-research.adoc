At link:https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania[Wikimania 2014] Elizabeth Marincola spoke about reconsidering the time-tested implementation of the scientific process of publication and peer-reviews by way of allowing a much more open access. As the CEO of link:http://www.plos.org/[PLOS] she has a very inspiring vision on this topic. I strongly recommend watching the link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haQtVc5F2HI[video of her keynote].
