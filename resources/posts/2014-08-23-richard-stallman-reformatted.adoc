This year Richard Stallman gave a presentation at TEDxGeneva, which is now available link:https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society[on video]. Having seen my fair share of Stallman presentations, it is quite noticeable how Stallman is forced to keep his presentation concise and keep the content aligned with the presented illustrations. Despite this struggling, the presentation gives a good summary of the many aspects of free software and the iconic illustrations make it very lively and understandable. Surely a video to recommend to others. (Despite the explicit note by Stallman to refrain from using the term ‘open-source’ I will classify it this way, mainly because free software includes freeware which is even more harmful than open-source software.)
