link:https://people.gnome.org/~federico/[Federico Mena Quintero] just published an link:https://people.gnome.org/~federico/news-2014-08.html#the-safety-and-privacy-team[extensive write-up] about the reason for having the Linux-desktop (GNOME) focus on user-security and user-safety. Federico in return was inspired by the talk by link:https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/[Matthew Garret] at GUADEC 2014, as featured by the link:https://lwn.net/Articles/607047/[Linux Weekly News]. By using the parallelism of city-safety, Federico attempts to describe the way in which the total (desktop/city)-environment is benefiting from the established level of security and the achieved level of safety. Iâ€™d like to think that security is about the hard-limits, whilst safety is about the soft-limits, both of which can be crossed depending on the experience of the user. In a sense serving a secure and safe freedom-oriented system would make it impossible for users to compromise their own safety, security and privacy unless specific additional features are enabled. Of course the details about these features should be made very clear to the user, in order to avoid users unknowingly endangering themselves. The small bits which can be worked on at GNOME are listed in the link:https://wiki.gnome.org/SafetyTeam/MeetingDocumentation[meeting documents] of the GNOME safety team.
