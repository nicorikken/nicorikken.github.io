Most people in the open-source community will already have heard about the link:https://www.crowdsupply.com/kosagi/novena-open-laptop[Novena project] as it is a well supported move for building an as-free-as-possible laptop. Just last week a link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzGEBJLlUIc[video] was published from a keynote given by link:https://twitter.com/xobs[Sean Cross] about the project. It is worth the watch, especially since it shows the ‘hidden’ process that resulted in the final design. The way in which the Novena laptop is able to support and empower hardware and software projects is stunning and it is probably this feature-set that aspires to all hackers out there and helps make the effort such a success.
