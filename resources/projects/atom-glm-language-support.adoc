For years now I've been interested in the link:http://gridlab-d.sourceforge.net/wiki/[GridLAB-D] power system simulation project.
A core piece of the interface are the _GLM files_ which contain the models to simulate, and possibly even the data used in the simulations.
Starting my journey into GridLAB-D, I quickly became aware of the lack of GLM syntax highlighting.
The syntax is broadly related to the syntax of C++, but that is hardly supporting the editing process.
Having just acquired some experience in creating highlighting support in the link:https://atom.io/[Atom] text editor in the context of the <<asciidoctor.adoc#,Asciidoctor>> projects, I decided to use my skills to create proper highlighting.
